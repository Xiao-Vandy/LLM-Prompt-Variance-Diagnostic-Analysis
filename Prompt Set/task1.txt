"So this T2 scan has motion blur and some slice misalignment—what might explain the unclear lesion edge?",
"Can you briefly explain why motion and slice issues might blur the lesion edge in a T2 scan?",
"This scan looks fuzzy throughout—where would you even place the lesion boundary given that distortion?",
"The fuzzy lesion edge may result from slice mismatch and motion in the T2 MRI.",
"If a T2 scan shows slice mismatch and motion artifacts, what could cause the lesion boundary to blur?",
"When examining this scan affected by motion and slice shift, what reasoning helps explain the unclear boundary?",
"Explain how motion and slice misalignment affect the lesion boundary.",
"Provide a short explanation of why motion and misaligned slices could lead to a blurry lesion boundary.",
"When someone asks why the lesion edge is hard to read in a fuzzy scan like this, how would you explain it?",
"What matters most when evaluating a lesion in a scan with motion artifacts?",
"You’re explaining this scan to a junior trainee—how would you describe why the lesion boundary isn’t distinct?",
"You’re writing a report—how would you describe why the lesion boundary is unclear?",
"Lesion unclear. Scan messy. Slices not match. Explain why.",
"Motion? Blur. Edge gone where. Image say nothing clear.",
"Slices broken. Edge floaty. Scan chaos. What logic now?"
