"Can you briefly explain what factors might mess with how we interpret this anti-inflammatory drug, especially if stress markers go up in stable patients?",
"Why might a medication intended to reduce stress instead worsen it in stable patients—and what could explain this contradiction in results?",
"So this drug makes stress go up even though it’s supposed to help—what might be messing with the results?",
"Given increased stress markers in stable patients taking an anti-inflammatory drug, what variables might confound the efficacy analysis?",
"Confounding variables should be considered when interpreting the efficacy of a drug that paradoxically elevates stress biomarkers in stable patients, despite being anti-inflammatory.",
"Were a drug to raise stress markers though meant to calm inflammation, how might its effects be falsely interpreted due to unseen variables?",
"Boil down the possible confounders in interpreting this drug’s impact, given stress markers rise instead of fall.",
"Explain in one sentence what hidden variables might account for increased stress from a drug meant to reduce inflammation.",
"Write a short explanation of what might interfere with understanding the real effect of this paradoxical inflammation medication.",
"What are some hidden influences on interpreting this drug’s result, where stress markers rise unexpectedly?",
"As a peer reviewer, how would you concisely flag confounding issues in a trial where an anti-inflammatory boosts stress indicators?",
"You’re writing a research summary—what potential confounders should you mention for this paradoxical inflammation drug?",
"Drug calm → stress up? stable patients. Why? Interpret effect, what confound?",
"Anti-inflammatory drug ↑ stress markers—what confounding variables affect efficacy interpretation?",
"Confuse effect if drug ∆ stress+stable→why factor? Say short."
